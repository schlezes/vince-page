These files were previously a separate website design that was hosted on the internet.

I removed this website from the internet to reduce my attack surface from the public domain as I approached closer into the world of Cyber Security.

it is time to showcase some of my work as a software developer and GitHub is a good place for my code to be viewed and evaluated.

From my Desktop is a screen shot of the files that were uploaded to this Readme.
