These files were previously a separate website design that was hosted on the internet.

I developed this website with HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, CSS-Flexbox and some JSON.

I liked using Typescript as it helped with locating "type" errors in some of my JavaScript code.

I tested this design in Firefox and Firefox-inspect setting, Google and Google inspect setting and on my iPhone. 

The design seemed responsive as far as I could take-it.

I removed this website from the internet to reduce my attack surface from the public domain as I approached closer into the world of Cyber Security.

However;

it is time to showcase some of my work as a software developer and GitHub is a good place for my code to be viewed and evaluated.

From my Desktop is a screen shot of the original website that I produced with the intent of introduction about my skill sets as a developer. All of the files that produce the above page and are listed below with a screen shot of the directory of files that were uploaded to this repository.

I use VScode for my development work and inside VScode there is a live server that I use for executing this code.

Once the live server is installed, a right click on the HTML source will open a dialog box and near the bottom is the "open with line server" entry.

Click on "open with line server" and usually within seconds the page will render.

I also attempted using Edge as the local host; however, it was "really" slow and I discontinued use of that option.

The following image is a screenshot for the opening page using port 5500 of 127.0.0.1/index.html.

I have two photos on the opening page as this is supposed to be a profile of me and that kind of means what I look like as well as what I perceive as important as a front-end developer.

If you use VScode, then you would be able to evaluate the code as well as view the page render all in one place.

Thanks,
